	abstract = {Data sharing presents extensive opportunities and challenges in domains such as the public sector, health care and financial services. This paper introduces the concept of "trusted data marketplaces" as a mechanism for enabling trusted sharing of data. It takes credit scoring-an essential mechanism of the entire world-economic environment, determining access for companies and individuals to credit and the terms under which credit is provisioned-as an example for the realization of the trusted data marketplaces concept. This paper looks at credit scoring from a data perspective, analyzing current shortcomings in the use and sharing of data for credit scoring, and outlining a conceptual framework in terms of a trusted data marketplace to overcome the identified shortcomings. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) identify and discuss the core data issues that hinder innovation in credit scoring; (2) propose a conceptual architecture for trusted data marketplaces for credit scoring in order to serve as a reference architecture for the implementation of future credit scoring systems. The architecture is generic and can be adopted in other domains where data sharing is of high relevance.},

@article{Yan2014a,
	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is going to create a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into information networks in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings. Trust management plays an important role in IoT for reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. It helps people overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engages in user acceptance and consumption on IoT services and applications. However, current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the properties of trust, propose objectives of IoT trust management, and provide a survey on the current literature advances towards trustworthy IoT. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues, specify research challenges and indicate future research trends by proposing a research model for holistic trust management in IoT. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{7004800,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network consisting of Internet-connected objects, such as Radio frequency identifications, sensors, actuators, as well as other instruments and smart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the future Internet. Over the last decade, we have seen a large number of the IoT solutions developed by start-ups, small and medium enterprises, large corporations, academic research institutes (such as universities), and private and public research organizations making their way into the market. In this paper, we survey over one hundred IoT smart solutions in the marketplace and examine them closely in order to identify the technologies used, functionalities, and applications. Based on the application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under five different categories: 1) smart wearable; 2) smart home; 3) smart city; 4) smart environment; and 5) smart enterprise. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for future research in the IoT and to motivate and inspire further developments. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing research and suggests a number of potentially significant research directions.},
